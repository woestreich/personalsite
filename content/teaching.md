Outreach and education, with an emphasis on equitable and inclusive approaches, are central to my personal goals as a researcher, educator, and human. Much like with my research, I aim to consistently educate myself in these areas while also putting what I learn into practice. Some of my education, outreach, and efforts toward promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion are detailed below (see [CV](../CV.pdf) for a more complete list):

### University courses
I have served as a teaching fellow, teaching assistant, and guest lecturer for a range of courses at Stanford University, Foothill College, and Northwestern University. Courses and lectures previously taught include marine conservation, field and statistical methods in ecology, introductory ecology & evolution, sensory ecology, and others. I have also developed undergraduate and graduate courses in conservation science and sensory and behavioral ecology. 

### Monterey Bay REU writing course
In 2019 and 2020, as a part of the outstanding broader programming offered through the [Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program](https://csumb.edu/reu) at CSUMB, I co-led a course focused on the graduate school application process, graduate fellowships, and proposal writing. This REU program has the stated goal of "increas[ing] the number and diversity of students pursuing Ocean Sciences careers," which we focused on in this course aimed at bringing clarity to the often-opaque processes of grad school applications and funding. 
 
 ### [Stanford Biology PhD Preview Program](https://biology.stanford.edu/academics/phd-program/stanford-biology-phd-preview-program)
This program focuses on improving transparency to remove unnecessary barriers in the process of applying to PhD programs in the United States. Please check out the program page if you are interested in pursuing a PhD in Biology at Stanford or other institutions! I was a co-founder and co-organizer of this program during my PhD studies.

### Salinas High School - Hopkins Marine Station Research Internship Program
For several years I served as the co-director of a paid, 5-month internship program focused on providing marine science research experiences for students from historically-marginalized backgrounds. This program has provided the first marine science experience for many students in recent years, and importantly provides funding in order to (1) avoid excluding students who must work a paid job after school hours; and (2) open conversations about science as a viable career path.

### Local community engagement via classroom visits, public talks, and exhibits
I regularly share the research process and recent findings with diverse audiences, ranging from elementary and middle school classrooms to the broader general public. In particular, I enjoy engaging audiences via interactive exhibits on our research in Monterey Bay, as these tend to facilitate more open and equal interactions and discussion!

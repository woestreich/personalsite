Outreach and education, with an emphasis on equitable and inclusive approaches, are central to my personal goals as both a scientist and citizen. Much like with my research, I aim to consistently educate myself in these areas while also putting what I learn into practice. My major education and outreach efforts are detailed below (see [CV](../CV.pdf) for a complete list of outreach activities):

### University courses
I have served as a teaching fellow, teaching assistant, and guest lecturer for a range of courses at Stanford University, Foothill College, and Northwestern University. Courses and lectures previously taught include marine conservation, field and statistical methods in ecology, introductory ecology & evolution, sensory ecology, and others. I have also developed and continue to refine an undergraduate course in marine conservation, which emphasizes and explores the intersection of biological, social, and technological dimensions in marine conservation problems. 

### Monterey Bay REU writing course
In 2019 and 2020, as a part of the outstanding broader programming offered through the [Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program](https://csumb.edu/reu) at CSUMB, I co-led a course focused on the graduate school application process, graduate fellowships, and proposal writing. This REU program has the stated goal of "increas[ing] the number and diversity of students pursuing Ocean Sciences careers," which we focused on in this course aimed at bringing clarity to the often-opaque processes of grad school applications and funding. I worked toward similar goals at my PhD institution as a co-organizer of the [Stanford Biology PhD Preview Program](https://biology.stanford.edu/academics/phd-program/stanford-biology-phd-preview-program).
 
### Local community engagement via classroom visits, public talks, and exhibits
I regularly share the research process and recent findings with diverse audiences, ranging from elementary and middle school classrooms to the broader general public. In particular, I enjoy engaging audiences via interactive exhibits on our research in Monterey Bay, as these tend to facilitate more open and equal interactions and discussion!


### Salinas High School - Hopkins Marine Station Internship Program
Along with my colleague Will Gough, I previously coordinated a longform science engagement program between Salinas High School and Hopkins Marine Station. This program pairs high school students with postdoc and PhD student research mentors at Hopkins for individualized, ~5 month research internships. These internships culminate in an end-of-program symposium highlighting the outcomes of the students' research projects.

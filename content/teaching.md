Outreach and education, with an emphasis on equitable and inclusive approaches, are central to my personal goals as both a scientist and citizen. Much like with my research, I aim to consistently educate myself in these areas while also putting what I learn into practice. My major education and outreach efforts are detailed below (see [CV](../CV.pdf) for a more complete list):

### University courses
I have served as a teaching fellow, teaching assistant, and guest lecturer for a range of courses at Stanford University, Foothill College, and Northwestern University. Courses and lectures previously taught include marine conservation, field and statistical methods in ecology, introductory ecology & evolution, sensory ecology, and others. I have also developed and continue to refine an undergraduate course in marine conservation, which emphasizes and explores the intersection of biological, social, and technological dimensions in marine conservation problems. 

### Monterey Bay REU writing course
In 2019 and 2020, as a part of the outstanding broader programming offered through the [Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program](https://csumb.edu/reu) at CSUMB, I co-led a course focused on the graduate school application process, graduate fellowships, and proposal writing. This REU program has the stated goal of "increas[ing] the number and diversity of students pursuing Ocean Sciences careers," which we focused on in this course aimed at bringing clarity to the often-opaque processes of grad school applications and funding. 
 
 ### [Stanford Biology PhD Preview Program](https://biology.stanford.edu/academics/phd-program/stanford-biology-phd-preview-program)
This program focuses on improving transparency to remove unnecessary barriers in the process of applying to PhD programs in the United States. Please check out the program page if you are interested in pursuing a PhD in Biology at Stanford or other institutions! I was a co-founder and co-organizer of this program during my PhD studies.

### Local community engagement via classroom visits, public talks, and exhibits
I regularly share the research process and recent findings with diverse audiences, ranging from elementary and middle school classrooms to the broader general public. In particular, I enjoy engaging audiences via interactive exhibits on our research in Monterey Bay, as these tend to facilitate more open and equal interactions and discussion!

## My research program centers on several (often overlapping) themes:

### Animal foraging & migration in an era of rapid global change

Migration is not only one of the most awe-inspiring biological phenomena on Earth, but also plays a central role in many ecological and evolutionary processes. This biologically complex behavior is also increasingly threatened in an era of rapid global change. My research in this area seeks to understand the sources of information (e.g., social cues, biotic & abiotic ecosystem conditions) that animals use to decide when and where to forage and migrate in patchy and dynamic ecosystems. I further investigate how foraging and migration strategies influence the adaptability of migratory populations to rapid environmental change.

### Bioacoustics for behavioral ecology & ecosystem monitoring

Bioacoustic approaches provide a unique opportunity to (1) quantify and link individual, group, and population-level behaviors; and (2) effectively sample enormous spatial areas from a single instrument. In my research, I leverage and develop bioacoustic tools for the advancement of both fundamental behavioral ecology and ecosystem monitoring using vocal animals as sentinel species. While much of my work to date in this area utilizes passive acoustics (listening using microphones), I increasingly use active acoustics (i.e., echosounders) to measure the behavior of non-vocal animals (e.g., krill).

### Resource management for migratory wildlife, dynamic ecosystems, & essential human activities

Ecosystem processes, wildlife populations, and human resource users are all inherently dynamic. In recent years, dynamic management approaches (i.e., flexible in space and time and often facilitated by advances in technology) have emerged as a means of more efficiently managing ecosystems for the protection of wildlife alongside human activities. Such dynamic approaches are particularly well-suited for the management of migratory populations and the ecosystems that they move through. My research in this area explores the development of tools for observing wildlife populations in near-real-time, while also critically considering novel issues of equity and ethics arising from this shift to technology-driven resource management.

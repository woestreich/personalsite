description:  What sources of information do animal individuals and groups rely on to make critical behavioral decisions (e.g., when/where to forage/migrate) in dynamic and changing ecosystems? How can we measure individual and group-level behavior in cryptic species and difficult-to-observe ecosystems? And in what ways can improved understanding and observation of animal behaviors aid in more effective and equitable ecosystem management by humans? <br/><br/> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/), where I explore these questions and their interactions, often combining approaches from behavioral ecology, bioacoustics, oceanography, and conservation science. <br/><br/> Previously, I completed a PhD in [Biology at Stanford University](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/) (2022), BS and MS degrees in [Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/research/areas/ecosystems.html) (2015), and held positions at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) and the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/).

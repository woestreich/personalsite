description:  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/), where I explore the behavior and conservation of migratory animals in dynamic and changing ecosystems. In this work, I combine approaches from behavioral ecology, bioacoustics, oceanography, and conservation science to better understand (1) how migratory animals make behavioral decisions in the face of environmental variability and change; and (2) how we as humans can more equitably and effectively manage ecosystems to ensure the protection of vulnerable wildlife alongside essential human resource uses. <br/><br/> Previously, I completed a PhD in [Biology at Stanford University](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/) (2022), BS and MS degrees in [Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/research/areas/ecosystems.html) (2015), and held positions at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) and the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/).

description:  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)](https://www.mbari.org/), where I explore animal behavior in dynamic and changing ecosystems. I address both theoretical and applied questions in this area by combining approaches from behavioral ecology, bioacoustics, oceanography, and conservation science. <br/><br/> Previously, I completed a PhD in [Biology at Stanford University](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/) (2022), BS and MS degrees in [Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/research/areas/ecosystems.html) (2015), and held positions at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu/) and the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

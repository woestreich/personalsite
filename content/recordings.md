As noted on my research page, I love bioacoustics! Recording both the sounds that animals make and whole ecosystem "soundscapes" can lead to incredible insight into how animals interact with their environment and one another. Such recordings can also be beautiful and enjoyable to listen to. Several example recordings that I have taken in a range of ecosystems are included below.

A California Myotis (*Myotis californicus*) foraging at dusk using echolocation. Listen for the drop in frequency and the decreasing interval between calls as this bat approaches its prey. This recording was taken using a Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter Mini Bat in my backyard in Pacific Grove, CA for an ongoing research project. I've slowed down the recording by 10x here to bring it into human hearing range (these echolocation calls are ultrasonic).

A migratory hoary bat (*Lasiurus cinereus*) recorded in the middle of the night in the Ventana Wilderness of Big Sur, CA. This recording was again taken using a Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter Mini Bat and slowed by 10x to bring the bat's calls into human hearing range. I've been lucky enough to record these migratory bats for two consecutive winters (2020 and 2021) while briefly visiting the Ventana Wilderness- we very rarely hear this species in residential Pacific Grove despite many more hours of acoustic survey!

Recording both the sounds that animals make and whole ecosystem "soundscapes" can lead to incredible insight into how animals interact with their environment and one another. These recordings can also be beautiful. Several example recordings that I've made of different species and behaviors are included below. They are visualized as scrolling spectrograms showing frequency vs. time, with color intensity indicating sound amplitude.

A California Myotis (*Myotis californicus*) foraging at dusk using echolocation. Listen for the drop in frequency and the decreasing interval between calls as this bat approaches its prey (sometimes called the "terminal buzz"). This recording was taken using a Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter Mini Bat in on the Monterey Peninsula (CA, USA) for an ongoing research project. I've slowed down the recording by 10x here to bring it into human hearing range (these echolocation calls are ultrasonic). <br/><br/>

A migratory hoary bat (*Lasiurus cinereus*) recorded in the middle of the night in the Ventana Wilderness of Big Sur, CA. This recording was again taken using a Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter Mini Bat and slowed by 10x to bring the bat's calls into human hearing range. I've been lucky enough to record these migratory bats for two consecutive winters (2020 and 2021) while briefly visiting the Ventana Wilderness. <br/><br/>

At least two species of bats are audible in this recording, taken in the rainforest of Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula. Recording is slowed by 5x in this case to make the calls easier to hear.
